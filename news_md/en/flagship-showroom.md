We are thrilled to announce the opening of our new flagship showroom in Shanghai. This 1,200 square meter space is designed not just as a display area, but as a collaborative laboratory.

## A Space for Co-Creation

Developers and designers can now work directly with our team to prototype show flats in real-time. The showroom features a vast material library, movable wall systems, and our complete collection of modular furniture.
