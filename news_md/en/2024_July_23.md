## Improve workplace comfort and productivity with innovative office chairs from Goldman Sachs International Hong Kong

[Hong Kong Goldman Sachs International Co., Ltd](https://www.gaoshenghk.com/about-us/). is a leading modern office furniture solutions provider, specializing in the research and development, production and sales of ergonomic office chairs, work chairs, training chairs with writing desks. The company has a strong presence in Europe, North America, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and more than 100 countries around the world and is committed to improving workplace comfort and productivity through its innovative and cost-effective products.

One of the company’s flagship products, the GT2A ergonomic office chair, has won widespread acclaim for its superior design and functionality. This employee work chair has obtained US [BIFMA](https://baike.baidu.com/item/BIFMA%E8%AE%A4%E8%AF%81/15594014) certification and features a self-weighted tilt mechanism, 2D armrests and tilt lock function. The GT3 series is the result of a collaboration between the Nogo R&D team and the Japanese design team TOYO TAPER, and represents a major advancement in office chair technology. Building on the success of the GT1 and GT2 chairs, the GT3A uses the same weight-tilt mechanism to provide unparalleled support based on the weight of the user’s back as they lean back. The combination of plastic shell and perforated backrest gives the GT3 series a refreshing and comfortable feeling, making it an ideal choice for the majority of users.

In July 2024, Hong Kong Goldman Sachs International Co., Ltd. established a partnership with schools in Saudi Arabia to supply a series of office chairs and training chairs. Positive feedback and usage pictures from customers in Saudi Arabia highlight the superior quality and functionality of the company’s products. The chairs were well received and put to good use, further cementing the company’s reputation for providing first-class office furniture solutions.
