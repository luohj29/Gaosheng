Sustainability is at the core of what we do. Our latest initiative involves a partnership with master bamboo artisans from Hangzhou.

## The Bamboo Project

Bamboo is an incredibly renewable resource, but working with it requires skill and patience. We have launched a residency program where these artisans work alongside our industrial designers.

The goal is to create a new line of curved wall panels that are both eco-friendly and aesthetically stunning.

Stay tuned for the product launch next season.
